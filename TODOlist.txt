Goals: 
Scope shot the interface
Develop a PCB to interface to the Boron
Build an endpoint for the results to be streamed to.
 
 useful files
 boron API: https://docs.particle.io/reference/device-os/firmware/

steps to get there 

firmare: 
1. boron make boron blinky
2. research boron gpio and communication protos
3. research SDI12 interface
4. write sample code to communicate sdi12 to boron
5. write to SQL server w/ boron
