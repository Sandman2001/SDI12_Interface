Goals: 
Scope shot the interface
Develop a PCB to interface to the Boron
Build an endpoint for the results to be streamed to.

steps to get there 

firmare: 
1. boron make boron blinky (done)
2. research boron gpio and communication protos (done)
3. research SDI12 interface (ACTIVE) (read 3-4. 7-appendix)
4. write sample code to communicate sdi12 to boron
5. write to SQL server w/ boron
